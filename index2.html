                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>Hello, my name is Franz Fernando.  I'm currently a student in the Computer Science program at Lambda School.  My background is primarily in electronics, particularly in digital and analog circuits.  I have been tasked with responsibilities at all levels of the manufacturing process whether it is with design, quality control, component level troubleshooting, drafting, as well as overseeing and implementing the steps in the overall process itself. I'm fortunate to have been able to gain these skills through nearly 16 years of work experience at Suzuki Musical Instruments.  My interest in electronics and engineering began at this company.  I have a strong drive to learn and improve upon my skills each day and during my endeavours I have built a strong foundation for the hardware and component side of things, but there was always one aspect that remained some what of a mystery to me- and that is the software and programming side of things.  Fortunately, Lambda School has presented me with the perfect opportunity to continue my pursuit of knowledge and goals.</p>
